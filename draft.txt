Let me take over the talk.

-------------------
[Two ways for a bead stabilization]
&&&&&
At delay 1 oritatami system, there are just two ways for a bead to get stabilized.

One is by binding
and the other is by tunnel setction

A tunnel section consists of one point surrounded by 4 beads.

--

If you enter form left,
you cannot help but exit to the right.


And the center bead is bound in order to enter tunnel section,
Once the transcript has used up free hands,
no bead can get stabilized deteministically anymore.

------
++[(TUのグラフページ)]

Basic proof principle is to show that
the number of free hands monotonically decrease at a constant rate.

This is how Demaine and others proved this black point.

------------------------

[Result d = 1]

In this work,
we proved these upper bounds
for deterministic unary oritatami system at delay 1.

Our upper bounds are proved only for unary alphabet so far.


Note that, case of arity 2 can make infinite structures
but these structure is zig-zag.

------------------
[zig-zag (at arity 2)]

Let me show you
how zig-zag folds at arity 2.


Given this structure as seed.

--

Next bead have to make a bond in order to stabilize deterministically.

--

"This" bead has a free hand and close enough to bind.
So these beads use each hands.

--

We can continue this way.

Once unary system is trapped at arity 2 in a zig-zag.
It cannot escape unless it colides with something.

----------
[(at arity 3)]

How about at larger arity?

A bead extends hands more then case of at arity 2
but the system cannot make zig-zag deterministically.

+-

This bead can bind to any of these 2 beads.
Hence, non-determinism.

--------------


[a = 4]
[explain hexagon]


Let me explain
why unary oritatami system at arity 4 cannot make
any structure larger than this size.

----

Without loss of generality,
the first bead is assumed to be at the origin,
then no bead outside hexagon of radius n at launch of the system.

---

"This" is the number of points in this hexagon.

Once you step outside hexagon,
you immediately encounter non-determinism.
Hence, this upper bound holds.


-----
-----

On the one hand, at arity 2,
the system can make a zig-zag structure.
but it must repeat zig-zag endlessly because nothing can stop.

In this case at arity 2,
this system is predictable in the arbitrarily far future.

Hence, the system is not Turing universal.


-----

In order to avoid zig-zag, this orange bead must bind to 2 beads
and its possible only inward.

Expanding the circumcircle by the unit distance costs free hands


Without any tunnel section, this proof could be done.

-----

However tunnel section exists
and create two hands.

That's not the case
because Troll ambushes in a tunnel.

Troll robs the free hand.

---

This is stated in Tunnel Troll Theorem.

Thus, at arity 2, a bead consumes freehands per beyond hexagon
and the number of free hands is not increased by Troll.




-------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
[TTT]

Tunnel Troll Theorem consists these 3 statements.


Tunnel section is this structure.
Tunnel is a structure of which the entrance bead and the exit bead is stabilized by using no tunnel.

------------------------------
[a = 4]

In unary oritatami system at arity 4,
a bead has 4 hands.
So, if there is a free point around a bead, then it has at least 1 free hand.


Hence, "these" two beads must use free hand.
That is, they are Troll.

So this blue bead consumes 2 hands and extends 2 hands.
Thus, number of freehands doesn't increase.

----------
[a = 3]

At arity 3,
a bead has 3 hands.
So, if there are two free point around a bead, it has at least 1 free hand.

Now, around "these" bead, there are two free point.
So these two beads are Troll.
Thus, number of free hand decreases.

--

%This case is also

--

%If all neighbors of blue bead are occupied, there are no troll
%but this is a dead end.

------------
[a = 2]

At arity 2,
a bead has 2 hands.
So, if there is a three point around a bead, then it has at least 1 free hand.

but now only 2 neighbors of this bead are free.


Now let me forcus its predecesser.

--

Then, 3 neighbors are free.

--

So these are Troll and this bead extends 2 hands.
Thus, the number of total free hands doesn't increase

--

%If this point is occupied.
%Then, this is Troll and this bead extends one hands because free space is one.

--

%If both side are occupied, then it is inside tunnel.


-------------------------

In addition, at arity 2,
An entrance of tunnel is also lying Troll.

Because, this free hand cannot use by Jordan curve theorem.
Once going through a tunnel,
the transcript goes beyond the border
and cannot come back.

So, this orange bead consumes free hand.


--------

Thank you for listening.


------------
------------------
--------------
---------------------------------
[(entrance)]

At arity 2, Troll exists at the exit of tunnel.

On the other hand, Troll exists at the entrance of tunnel, too.

Type of tunnel sections are these 3.
Let me explain Straight and Obtuse tunnel sections.

They tunnel sections are same entrance shape.

---------
[Directions]

Ways of reach to these entrance is 3 ways.
If this orange bead is stabilized by using bond,
then it consumes free hands totally.

-----

Because tunnel walls are on one path,
so the hands of orange bead is never used.

This orange bead are and succesors are are separated.

------

If this orange bead is stabilized by tunnel section.
Then, left case is cannot follow
and center case is lying Troll
and right case is inside tunnel.

Therefore, this orange bead is stabilized by bond
and consumes free hands.

[Result d = 1]

a=2以外は無限構造を作れない。
a=2はzig-zagなら作れる。

[(how to make a zig-zag conformation)]
a=2の場合

赤をseedだとして、次のbeadを固定する時
周囲のfreehandは一個しかないのでそこと結合
更にその次を考えても、周囲のfreehandは一個しかないので、
そこと結合


a=3の場合

周囲のbeadのうち二つがfreehandを持っている、(かつ同時に手を結ぶことができない)ため
非決定。

----------------------
[Two ways for a bead to get stabilized]
d=1の場合、この二つの方法でbeadの位置を決定することができる。

一つは先ほど説明したように、freehandを持っているbeadとbondを結ぶ方法
もう一つは、このTunnel sectionを使う方法。
