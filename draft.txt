Troll


Let me talk about the unary system at delay 1.

-------------------
[Two ways for a bead stabilization]
&&&&&
At delay 1 oritatami system, there are just two ways for a bead to get stabilized.

One is by binding
and the other is by tunnel setction

A tunnel section consists of one free point and 4 occpied neighbors.

--

If you enter this tunnel section form left,
you cannot help but exit to the right.


And the center bead is bound in order to enter tunnel section,
hence, if the transcript spends all bond, the system cannot use tunnel section.

Once the transcript has used up free hands,
no bead can get stabilized deteministically anymore.

------
++[(TUのグラフページ)]

Basic proof principle is to show that
the number of free hands monotonically decrease at a constant rate.

------------------------

[Result d = 1]

In this work,
we proved these upper bounds
for deterministic unary oritatami system at delay 1.

At arity 1, "10n" is a known upper bound even for non unary system.
Our upper bounds are only for unary system.


Note that, case of arity 2 can make infinite structures
but these structure is zig-zag.

------------------
[zig-zag (at arity 2)]

Let me show you
how zig-zag folds at arity 2.


Given this structure as seed.

--

Next bead have to make a bond in order to stabilize deterministically.

--

"This" bead has a free hand and close enough to be bound.
So these beads use each hands.

--

We can continue this way.

Once unary system is trapped at arity 2 in a zig-zag.
It cannot escape unless it colides with something.

----------
[(at arity 3)]

How about at larger arity?

A bead extends hands more then case of at arity 2
but the system cannot make zig-zag deterministically.

+-

This bead can bind to any of these 2 beads.
Hence, non-determinisic.

--------------


[a = 4]
[explain hexagon]


Let me explain
why unary oritatami system at arity 4 cannot make
any structure larger than this.

----

Without loss of generality,
Assume first bead is at origin,
then no bead outside hexagon of radius n at launch of the system.


Suppose that unary oritatami system at arity 4 can produse
an infinite structure.
Then, the transcript has to exit this hexagon.

so let me focuse this moment.

-----
[explain to exit to hexagon]


In order to stabilize "this" bead,
it has to be bound to a bead at edge of this hexagon.
but, at edge of this blue structure,
There is a bead which has free hand.

Hence, 

-----
-----

On the one hand, at arity 2,
the system can make a zig-zag structure.
but it must repeat zig-zag endlessly because nothing can stop.

Hence, in this case at arity 2,
the system is not Turing universal.


-----

In order to avoid zig-zag, this orange bead has to use 2 free hands.

-----

At arity 2, a bead extends 2 hands,
so if a bead uses 2 hands, then free hands are consumed.
It just uses one hand, then the number of free hands remains.

If a bead is stabilized by tunnel, it may increases the number of free hands

---

but, in fact, Troll is lying in a tunnel.
Troll robs the free hand.

---

This is stated in Tunnel Troll Theorem.

Thus, at arity 2, a bead consumes freehands per beyond hexagon
and the number of free hands is not increased by Troll.




-------------------------------------------------
----------------------------------------
[TTT]

Tunnel Troll Theorem consists these 3 statements.

_arity 4: no free hand supplies per a tunnel section
_arity 3: Troll consumes per a tunnel section.
_arity 2: Troll consumes per a tunnel.

Tunnel section is a structure which occupied 4 point of a point.
Tunnel is a structure of which the entrance bead and the exit bead is stabilized by using no tunnel.

------------------------------
[a = 4]

In unary oritatami system at arity 4,
a bead has 4 hands.
So, if there is a free point around a bead, then it has at least 1 free hand.


Hence, "these" two beads must use free hand.
That is, they are Troll.

So this blue bead consumes 2 hands and extends 2 hands.
Thus, number of freehands doesn't increase.

----------
[a = 3]

At arity 3,
a bead has 3 hands.
So, if there are two free point around a bead, it has at least 1 free hand.

Now, around "these" bead, there are two free point.
So these two beads are Troll.
Thus, number of free hand decreases.

--

This case is also

--

If all neighbors of blue bead are occupied, there are no troll
but this conformation is terminal.

------------
[a = 2]

At arity 2,
a bead has 2 hands.
So, if there is a three point around a bead, then it has at least 1 free hand.

but now only 2 neighbors of this bead are free.


Now let me forcus its predecesser.

--

Then, 3 neighbors are free.

--

So these are Troll and this bead extends 2 hands.
Thus, the number of total free hands doesn't increase

--

If this point is occupied.
Then, this is Troll and this bead extends one hands because free space is one.

--

If both side are occupied, then it is inside tunnel.


-------------------------

In addition, at arity 2,
An entrance of tunnel is also lying Troll.

Because, this free hand cannot use by Jordan curve theorem.

Jordan curve theorem is saying that ..

So, this orange bead consumes hand and supplies no free hand.





------------
------------------
--------------
---------------------------------
[(entrance)]

At arity 2, Troll exists at the exit of tunnel.

On the other hand, Troll exists at the entrance of tunnel, too.

Type of tunnel sections are these 3.
Let me explain Straight and Obtuse tunnel sections.

They tunnel sections are same entrance shape.

---------
[Directions]

Ways of reach to these entrance is 3 ways.
If this orange bead is stabilized by using bond,
then it consumes free hands totally.

-----

Because tunnel walls are on one path,
so the hands of orange bead is never used.

This orange bead are and succesors are are separated.

------

If this orange bead is stabilized by tunnel section.
Then, left case is cannot follow
and center case is lying Troll
and right case is inside tunnel.

Therefore, this orange bead is stabilized by bond
and consumes free hands.

[Result d = 1]

a=2以外は無限構造を作れない。
a=2はzig-zagなら作れる。

[(how to make a zig-zag conformation)]
a=2の場合

赤をseedだとして、次のbeadを固定する時
周囲のfreehandは一個しかないのでそこと結合
更にその次を考えても、周囲のfreehandは一個しかないので、
そこと結合


a=3の場合

周囲のbeadのうち二つがfreehandを持っている、(かつ同時に手を結ぶことができない)ため
非決定。

[Two ways for a bead to get stabilized]
d=1の場合、この二つの方法でbeadの位置を決定することができる。

一つは先ほど説明したように、freehandを持っているbeadとbondを結ぶ方法
もう一つは、このTunnel sectionを使う方法。
